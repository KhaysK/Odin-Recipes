        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Mozzarella sticks are very easy to make at home. They're deep-fried until golden<br> 
            and crispy on the outside, with melted gooey cheese on the inside. They're so good<br> 
            and take just minutes to fry! Try dipping them in a marinara sauce! </h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl.<br>
                Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl.<br>
                Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
            <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture.<br>
                Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat.<br>
                Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
            <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil.<br>
                Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.<br>
                Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
        </ol>
