                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <h3>Mozzarella sticks are very easy to make at home. They're deep-fried until golden
                        and crispy on the outside, with melted gooey cheese on the inside. They're so good 
                        and take just minutes to fry! Try dipping them in a marinara sauce! </h3>

                    <ul style="font-size: 15px;">
                        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>¼ cup water</li>
                        <li>1½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
                        <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                        <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl.
                            Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
                        <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture.
                            Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat.
                            Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack.</li>
                        <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil.
                            Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds.</li>
                    </ol>
